	# Load balancing is a mechanic which profiles and throttles down lagging entities, tileentities and event subscribers.
	# It is used to prevent a certain laggy mob or block from lagging out the whole game. Since this is rather invasive and may cause the lagging
	# entity/block to not work nicely it is only done once the game goes over the configured lagging threshold.
	# Those thresholds as set in miliseconds, anything below 50ms is 20 TPS (1s = 1000ms, 1000 / 50 = 20).
	# Above 50ms ticks is where your game starts to lag, as it hits 100% cpu and starts skipping ticks.
	# This is where load balancing comes in and reduces the lag caused by specific entities and blocks.
	# If you run into trouble with some of the entities or blocks not working correctly you can disable it here
